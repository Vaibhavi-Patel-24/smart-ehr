- **Biometric Authentication:** Fingerprint and QR code verification for secure login.  
- **Real-Time Location Sharing:** Track and share responder location during emergencies.  
- **AI-Powered Recommendations:** Python ML models analyze patient data to suggest critical actions.  
- **Responsive Web UI:** Built with React and Tailwind CSS for fast, intuitive use.  

## How It Works
1. User authentication via biometrics (fingerprint/QR) or traditional login.  
2. Role-based access determines what EHR data can be viewed.  
3. Emergency responders can access patient records in real time.  
4. Real-time location sharing helps coordinate emergency response.  
5. AI engine provides critical recommendations based on patient history.
